# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: SANJAI R

*DOMAIN*: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

*TASK DESCRIPTION*

This task involves building a simple speech recognition system using Arduino UNO and an LED. The system responds to voice commands received via Bluetooth from an Android smartphone. Voice commands such as “ON” or “OFF” are converted into text by the mobile app and sent to the Arduino via a Bluetooth module (HC-05).The Arduino processes these commands and switches the LED ON or OFF. This task demonstrates speech-based control using Bluetooth communication and digital output control with Arduino.

*COMPONENTS USED*

    Arduino UNO

    HC-05 Bluetooth Module

    LED

    220Ω Resistor

    Relay Module

    Breadboard and Jumper Wires

    Android Phone with Serial Bluetooth Terminal App

*WORKING PRINCIPLE*

The user speaks "ON" or "OFF" into the Android app.
The app converts speech to text and sends it via Bluetooth (HC-05) to Arduino UNO.
Arduino reads the incoming command through the serial port.
If the command is "ON", the LED lights up. If it's "OFF", the LED turns off.

*OUTPUT*
